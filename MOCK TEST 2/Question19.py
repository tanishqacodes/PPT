# Write a function called ‘calculate_mean’ that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean (average) of the numbers. The function should calculate the mean using the sum of the numbers divided by the total count.

# Example:

# def calculate_mean(numbers):
#     total = sum(numbers)
#     count = len(numbers)
#     mean = total / count
#     return mean

# data = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
# mean_value = calculate_mean(data)
# print("Mean:", mean_value)

# Output:
# Mean: 20.0

def meanCalculate(nums):
    total = sum(nums)
    N = len(nums)
    mean = total / N
    return mean

input = [11,12,13,14,15]
print(meanCalculate(input))
